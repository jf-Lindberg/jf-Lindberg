👋 Hi, I’m @jf-Lindberg here on GitHub - in real life you can call me Filip (or as some of my friends do, Dr. Phil).

I am currently studying Software Engineering with a focus on Web Development at Blekinge Tekniska Högskola in Sweden. Our present studies revolve around HTML/CSS, PHP, SQL and Python.
